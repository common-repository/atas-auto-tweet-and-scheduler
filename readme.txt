== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= ATAS doesn't auto post the scheduled posts on Twitter = 
ATAS is using the WordPress built in wp_cron function that isn't perfect. If your website does not have visitors in every minute it is recommended to use the real cronjob instead of the wp_cron. If you need some help to configure your ATAS please contact us.
